/**
 * A simple console-based "Guess the Number" game that allows two players to take turns guessing a secret number.
 *
 * In this game:
 * - One player chooses a secret number between 0 and 100.
 * - The other player (computer or human) attempts to guess the number.
 * - The computer uses a binary search strategy to guess the number efficiently.
 * - Feedback is provided after each guess to indicate whether the guess was too high, too low, or correct.
 * - Each player is allowed a maximum of 5 guesses per round.
 *
 * **Obligatory Cut Corners and Simplifications:**
 * - For demonstration purposes, the human playerâ€™s secret number is randomly chosen in the `chooseSecretNumber` method.
 *   In a full implementation, it would be possible to add prompt ability for input.
 * - Human guesses are passed as program arguments in the Kotlin Playground, limiting interactivity.
 * - The game consists of two rounds, switching roles between players.
