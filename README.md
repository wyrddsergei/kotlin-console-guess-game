# Guess the Number Game

## Description

"Guess the Number" is a console-based game developed in Kotlin where two players take turns guessing a secret number between 0 and 100. One player (the Secret Keeper) selects a number, and the other player (the Guesser) tries to guess it based on hints provided. The game encourages interaction and fun between the players.

## Features

- **Two Players**: The game is played between a Guesser and a Secret Keeper.
- **Interactive Gameplay**: Players take turns guessing the number, receiving hints if their guess is too high or too low.
- **Input Validation**: The game validates player input, ensuring only numbers between 0 and 100 are accepted.
- **Attempt Limitation**: Players are limited to a maximum of 10 attempts to guess the correct number.
- **Role Reversal**: After each round, players can swap roles to continue the fun.

1. **Run the Game**: Compile and run the Kotlin code in a compatible environment, such as [Kotlin Playground](https://play.kotlinlang.org).
2. **Enter Player Names**: Each player will be prompted to enter their name.
